# WebScraper_Python
Web Scraper written in VS Code, using pandas library.

Web Scraper designed to assist in creating a map of available jobs internationally. This was written in python, using the pandas library. After, I used a function to turn my dataset into a csv file. The csv file was uploaded to Tableau and turned into a geographical map.
